               <p class="myP">In order to qualify for training, all participants must be able to complete a test consisting of  basic arithmetics, basic science, swimming, running, and a option between engineering or medicine.</p>              
               <p class="myP">Training will take 2 years to complete in order to weed out all necessary people and finally pick a group of 4 astronauts and 6 alternatives</p>
               <p class="myP">The training is broken up into 5 stages and participants will be weeded out after each stage: <br> <br> 
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Stage 1 (3 months): Learning about the basics about all ships they may take and starting strength training
                        <ul><li>Individuals will take a test at the end of this stage and top 35 individuals will move on to next stage
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>Stage 2(3 months): Continuing to learn about ships and starting to undergo simulations that prepare them for life in space
                    <ul><li>Top 15 individuals move on
                    </li></ul></li><br>
                <li>Stage 3(8 months): Individuals are split into groups determining what job on the spacecraft they will do and will start job specific training and simulations, survival training, starting to increase strength training
                    <ul><li>Top 10 individuals move on
                    </li></ul></li><br>
                <li>Stage 4(6 months): All individuals in this stage will eventually become a starter astronaut or alternate so all individuals will undergo bonding exercises in ship simulations, start public speaking courses, learn how to use the space suit, as well as continue job specific and strength training  
                        <ul><li>At end of this stage, selections between who is a starter and whos an alternate will take place</li></ul></li><br>
                 <li>Stage 5(4 months): All individuals will continue job specific training, 4 main astronauts will start interviews with the public, and in weeks leading up to launch the 4 main astronauts will move into same building with monitered activities and food in order to reduce risk of last minute illnesses or issues leading up to launch 
</li>
